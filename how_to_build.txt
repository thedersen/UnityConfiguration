Building
--------------

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the root folder (should contain rakefile.rb) of the project
2. To run the default build (which will compile, test and package UnityConfiguration) type the following command:

	rake

In addition, you can see the full list of all the build tasks by running:

	rake -T

To run a particular task ('test' for example), use the following command:

	rake test

After the build has completed, there will be a new folder in the root called "build". It contains the following folders:

* binaries -> All the UnityConfiguration assembilies and their dependencies
* nuget -> The UnityConfiguration[version].nupkg
